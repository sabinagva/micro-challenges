# Looping through an Array of Objects Checkpoint

Create a function that takes in an array of employee objects. Each employee object will come in with a property called `yearsOfExperience`.
Your function should return the total years of experience for all of the employees.

## Examples:

### Example 1

```js
let result = yourFunction([
    { name: "Tony", yearsOfExperience: 10 }, 
    { name: "Carla", yearsOfExperience: 4 }
]);
console.log(result);
```

should log 

```
14
```

### Example 2

```js
let result = yourFunction([
    { name: "Tony", yearsOfExperience: 10 }, 
    { name: "Carla", yearsOfExperience: 4 },
    { name: "Kris", yearsOfExperience: 14 }
]);
console.log(result);
```
